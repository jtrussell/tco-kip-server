There are three categories (beginner, casual and competitive) to be chosen when creating a game which gives an indication of what to expect, but it doesn't enforce anything. Even though personal stats are not being tracked, most players still very much appreciate a formal concede by clicking the ‘Concede’ button and typing ‘gg’ before leaving a game. The reality of quick and anonymous online games dictates this won’t always happen though, as evidenced by regular complaining in the main lobby about people leaving without conceding. Our advice is to just move on to the next game since in the end, conceding or not doesn’t really impact anything.

It was an ambitious undertaking for our team and we wouldn't have been successful without everyone's encouragement, patience, and participation. Our desire to grow and connect the global online KeyForge community was a key goal of our team since its inception.\n                    </Paragraph>\n                    <Paragraph>\n                        Now that Shadow Worlds is complete, our team has decided to take a step back from running tournaments and to shut down <Link newTab text='kiptournaments.com' url='https://kiptournaments.com'/> and <Link newTab text='thecrucibletracker.com' url='https://www.thecrucibletracker.com'/>. These actions will give us time to focus on other team goals and pursuits.\n                    </Paragraph>\n                    <Paragraph>\n                        While we step back from these projects we do want to encourage the community to carry on with the momentum we created. We are happy to support the current and future innovators in online KeyForge as best we can. We encourage everyone to use our experiences as a reference point and to leverage our open source code.\n\n                    </Paragraph>\n                    <Paragraph>\n                        These changes will cause disruption in the near term, for which we are sorry.
